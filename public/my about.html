<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Fatima and i am from kaduna Nigeria, a while back i was made to attend  a reknowned computer instution, 
  Dialogue computer school, to learn about the basics of the web, i paid for their beginner's course in programming,
  web design and development, and software management. They seemed promising and it was a 3 month program but right from
  the start of the lesson i began to lose interest in the course, i became unserious about it and deep down i had this
  notion of not wanting anything to do with it after we've completed the term we paid for   </p>

<p>We got done with the program and bagged a certificate which i was sure would prove invalid because i had zero to little
  knowlege of what was being taught. i went about my daily business unbothered about harboring a passion towards anything that 
  pertains to skills in web or the computer until i've had to have a different perception of it. i came to realize it couldn't 
  be as bad as i've made it to be and maybe i jsut didn't have a right start in it </p>

<p>So i developed competence for the skills and i decided to have a proper start from a very authentic and reliable source. i was
  sooner or later introduced to this app called Udemy, an academy or a porfolio that teaches web related courses online, i started 
  on a particular tutorial for web development, this time around keen and interested to learn and all i have to say now is that i couldnt
  have made a better choice.  </p>
